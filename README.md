Each category contains submenus, structured step-by-step to guide the user through tasks without confusion or the need to memorize commands.

This menu-driven design ensures:

* Beginner-friendly navigation
 ~ Users can perform advanced operations without needing deep technical knowledge of command syntax.

Reduced operational errors
Clearly labeled options and confirmation prompts help prevent mistakes during testing.

Faster workflow for professionals
Experienced users can quickly jump to specific modules without typing long commands.

Interactive feedback
Scan results, logs, warnings, and execution details appear neatly formatted for readability.

The interface is clean, structured, and optimized for clarity, ensuring that even large datasets, deep scans, and multi-stage tasks are presented in an understandable and professional manner. It is especially useful in training environments where students need a guided experience while learning cybersecurity techniques.

## 2. Command-Line Interface (CLI) Integration

For advanced users who prefer speed, precision, and scriptability, Accurate-Cyber-Defense-Multi-Purpose-Tool-V0.0.1 includes a robust command-line interface. Each module can be triggered via terminal commands, allowing seamless automation, integration with scripts, and execution in servers or remote systems.
